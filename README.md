# VideoPlayerJetpackCompose
Jetpack Compose Video Player is an android app that lets you stream videos from the provided API. The app has a simple and intuitive UI with a video player at the top and a scrollable details section at the bottom. You can easily control the playback with custom media controls that let you play/pause, and skip to the next/previous video. You can also access a list of videos sorted by date, fetched from the API. The app also provides a rich and informative details section that shows the title, author, and description of the current video. When you change the screen orientation, the app automatically adjusts to show only the video player for an immersive viewing experience.

This project utilize Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, Kotlin, Live Data, etc.

## Tasks

 1. Display a screen similar to the provided wireframe. The screen should

Getting Started With the Server Backend (/server)
-----------------------------------------------
For this exercise a pre-built server application is provided. The application runs by default on `localhost:4000` and has the following endpoints:

 - `http://localhost:4000/videos` - returns a JSON-encoded array of videos.

### Running the Server

The provided API server is needed as a data source for your project. To run the server you will need NodeJS and Yarn.

![](docs/apple.svg) On macOS you can install the requirements using Homebrew ([installation instructions](https://brew.sh/)) with:

```sh
brew install node yarn
```

![](docs/linux.svg) On Linux, use your distributionâ€™s package manager to install Node JS and Yarn. Node 10 or greater is required. You may need to add repositories:

 - https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions
 - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable

![](docs/windows.svg) On Windows, the best option is to use package installers from:

 - https://nodejs.org/en/download/, and
 - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

With dependencies installed, you can run the server with:

```sh
cd server
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can verify the API is working by visiting http://localhost:4000/videos in your browser or another HTTP client.
